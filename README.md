Front end for medhacks app that I helped make

## What It Does

This is the frontend for an app that helps to make any dermotology related clinical trials easier. It lets the people participating take images of the areas of their skin being studied to the people administering the trial. I worked mostly on the front end mobile app but also helped with the backend for this app. The app is planned to have machine vision features for detecting issues and giving automatic statistics on the dermatology issues in each picture.
